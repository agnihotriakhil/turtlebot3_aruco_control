# ROS-TurtleBot-AruCo-PID
This project provides a framework for a PID controlled Turtlebot3 Burger which localizes itself in an indoor environment using ArUco mapping. The trajectory input is given by the user and current position is calculated using AruCo markers placed in the environment which then are passed into the PID controller.
